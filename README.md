## POLS8042: Quantitative Methods for Political Science

### Welcome

Welcome to POLS8042: Quantitative Methods for Political Science. This course is offered to students registered in the MA POLS and HDR POLS programme.

The primary objective of this course is to provide an introduction to basic descriptive and inferential statistics to students who have little or no background in quantitative methods. If you have already completed POLS2044 (or equivalent) you should look for alternative courses to substitute POLS8042.

The course is designed around 12 weeks of independent online study. Each week students will watch a series of short videos on the week's subject matter. The videos are accompanied by a practical lab, some ungraded application exercises, and finally a weekly homework assessment. The first week of the course focuses primarily on data management; the second half covers descriptive and inferential statistics. Students will write a take-home final examination after Week 12.

### Grades and assessments

Students will be assessed on three (3) criteria: Seminar participation, weekly assessments, final exam. The breakdown of the grades is as follows:

| Grade                 | Percentage |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Seminar participation | 20         |
| Weekly assessments    | 50         |
| Final examination     | 30         |

1.  Seminar participation. This will be subjectively assessed based on students contribution and conversation to each other and the convenor on the Slack channel. "Participation" can include, but is not limited to discussing the assessments, helping (but not providing answers) fellow students understand concepts and application, discussing the applicability of the course materials to research and real world political events... Note that participation must be consistent throughout the course. Front or backloading participation will not result in a strong participation grade.

2.  Students will complete and submit weekly assessments starting in Week 02 and ending in Week 11 (10 assessments in total). Assessments will be made available on the RStudio.cloud platform on Tuesday at 12 noon (AEST) and are to be submitted by email before 12:01am the following Monday. Assessments will be graded and returned to students before the deployment of the next assessment on Tuesday. Grades will be posted to Wattle.

3.  Students will write a take home final exam after Week 12.
